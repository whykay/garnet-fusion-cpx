# Cartoon Network: Garnet's Palm Gems from Steven Universe - Port from MakeCode to CircuitPython

A port of Adafruit Cartoon Network MakeCode: Garnet's Palm Gems from Steven Universe to Circuit Python for this CPX project. Originally a small project as part of Dublin Raspberry Pi Jam a few years ago.

### Project 
Learn how to create Garnet's fusion from Ruby and Sapphire using Circuit Playground Express!
This is a solo Circuit Playground Express gem that transforms colors.

### What you will need
* [Adafruit Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) or [Circuit Playground Bluefruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4333)
* [USB cable - USB A to Micro-B](https://www.adafruit.com/product/592)

This project uses CircuitPython, you will need to [update your Circuit Playground Express Bootloader](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/updating-the-bootloader)

And then you need to [install the latest version of CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/circuitpython-quickstart).

You will need an editor, recommend to [download and install Mu Editor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/installing-mu-editor).

When you open the Mu Editor, it will pick up your Circuit Playground Express, and [you can open and edit code on the Circuit Playground Express](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/creating-and-editing-code).

Download or copy the code from [main.py](https://github.com/whykay/garnet-fusion-cpx/blob/main/main.py), save it.

* The neopixel lights should have one half in blue and the other half in red.
* Press "a" button and it will change of the neopixels to pink and play the [Steven Universe theme song](https://youtu.be/6OIGgDiHszo?si=0E35h2SGxG7UuJO4).
* Press "b" button and it will change from pink to sparkles, make some bleepy noises before turning back to blue and red neopixels.

Enjoy! Any questions, email vicky@codinggrace.com.
